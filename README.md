# JS-practice-slider
As part of learning Javascript, an exercise illustrating a testimonial slider

I am doing John Smilga's Javascript Projects course on Udemy. This was one of the projects, and I always try to make things different than that of the lecturer 
to show that I absorb what they are trying to teach, instead of just parroting back their own code. It is for this reason that I decided to start uploading my
projects onto an online platform, to showcase what I've learned, and also because I would like to showcase that one needn't simply mimick what one is taught.
